Aim:

                To detect and recognize the face and we can differentiate between citizen and criminals and further investigate whether the identified person is criminal or not.

Abstract:

            Face recognition can be considered one of the most successful biometric identification methods among several types of biometric identification including fingerprints, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition and retina. Face recognition provides biometric identification that utilizes the uniqueness of faces for security purposes. The problem with face recognition using biometric identification is its lengthy process and the accuracy of the results. This paper proposes solutions for a faster face recognition process with accurate results. The proposed face recognition process was done using a Machine Learning. This improved face recognition approach was able to recognize multiple faces with high accuracy level.

Proposed System:

            The proposed system consists of 4 steps, including training of real time images, multiple face detection, comparison of trained real time images with images from the surveillance camera, result based on the comparison. In our proposed system, the video obtained from the camera will be converted into frames. When a face is detected in a frame, it is preprocessed where noise and redundancies are reduced. The processed real time image is compared with the processed images already stored in the database. If he is criminal/suspect, we get a notification from android through firebase.
